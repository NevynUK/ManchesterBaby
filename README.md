Manchester Baby (Small Scale Experimental Machine)

The [Manchester Small Scale Experimental Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Small-Scale_Experimental_Machine) was the worlds first computer capable of executing a stored program.  The 32-bit architecture utilised an instruction set using only 3 bits allowing 8 possible instructions.  The program was stored in 32 memory locations (or store lines) with both data and program sharing storage (von Neumann architecture).

## Emulator

The Emulator implements a simplified version of the Manchester Baby.  The main program is able to read simple assembler files and execute the programs contained.  The program displays the status of the machine at the start and end of the program run.

Source files for the emulator are available for the following platforms:

* C++ Desktop
* C++ Running on NuttX RTOS (Coming Soon)
* Python Desktop
