# C++ Implementation

The files and folders held here implement an emulator for the SSEM.  The emulator can be run on a desktop computer and eventually will be able to run on the NuttX RTOS.

## Desktop

The Desktop folder holds the file necessary to build the system ru run on a desktop computer.  It also contains script files to allow the system to be run and put through its paces using valgrind.

## NuttX

This folder contains the NuttX specific files as well as the core implementation of the emulator.
